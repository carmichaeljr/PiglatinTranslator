# PiglatinTranslator
A piglatin translator written in python

This translator has the ability to translate both to and from piglatin, aiding conversation both ways. The language that is used when the user types out a message is automaticly detected and then translated accordingly.
As a bonus, it can translate to gibberish. (It can't translate back though, it is gibberish after all.)
