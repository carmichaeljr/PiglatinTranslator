# PiglatinTranslator
A piglatin translator written in python

This translator has the ability to translate both to and from piglatin, aiding conversation both ways. The language that is used when the user types out a message is automaticly detected and then translated accordingly. To make this translator easier to use, a help menu is included.
As a bonus, it can translate to gibberish. (It can't translate back though, it is gibberish after all.)

This script is meant to run from the terminal, and does not have a GUI attached. (Future project???)
